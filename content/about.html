<h1>Life</h1>
<p>Growing up I had the great opportunity to move around the world. I was born in Delhi but I’ve lived in many cities including Kolkata, Bangkok, Dubai, and Cork (It’s a small city in Ireland). I’m very grateful to have met so many people and learned so much from them, I just wish I’d picked up a few more languages! I only speak English, Hindi, and French.</p>
